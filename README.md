# Key Points 
# Plannings
I give the object-fit: cover; property so that image cover all the remaining area but without without distortion and give obect-position: center; property so that when images trimmed based on screen size that time my center part of images will be shown.
I give overflow: hidden; property to the parent div due to this no scroll bar is coming even in x/y direction.
I give position: relative; property to the parent div because relative does not leave it's space and take the position with respect to itself only.
I give position: absolute; property to the div which is haveng Heading and button because absolute left it's space so it is not disturbing it's parent div and it's takes position with respect to it's nearest positioned parent and I am trying to keep this div middle in all the screeen sizes dinamically with the help calc().
I give opacity property to the image so that it's look like transparent.
